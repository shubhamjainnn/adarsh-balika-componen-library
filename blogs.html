      <p>
        In this blog we have discussed about JavaScript functions which are
        blocks of code and are executed repeatedly. Function helps us to avoid
        repeating the same code all over the place. You can use a function to
        wrap that code and reuse it. Functions can take zero or more than one
        argument.

      <h3>What is var and let in JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>
        The keywords let and var both declare new variables in JavaScript. The
        difference between let and var is in the scope of the variables they
        create: Variables declared by let are only available inside the block
        where they're defined.
